Run 'wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz' to get the
compressed coreutils files

Run 'tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz' to decompress files in current directory

Run 'mkdir coreutils' to create an install destination, then enter the coreutils
source folder with 'cd coreutils-7.6.tar.gz'

Run './configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/amit/coreutils' as mentioned in the
INSTALL file to configure coreutils. Also, note that Prof. Eggert is credited
in the README file.

Then run 'make' and 'make install' to compile and then install the coreutils
package.

Run 'export LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8', then 'coreutils/bin/ls -l' in the home
directory, and compare with the result of 'ls -l' to see the difference in date
format.

Now copy and paste Brady's patch into a file called coreutilfix.patch.

In the 'coreutils-7.6/' directory, run 'patch -p1 < ../coreutilfix.patch'. The 
patch ended with two errors reading 'patch unexpectedly ended in middle of line'
, but it still successfully patched two hunks.

Because the patched and unpatched versions are expected to exist alongside 
one another, create a directory for the fixed version of coreutils with
'mkdir fixedcoreutils'. Go to the 'coreutils-7.6' directory and configure it
with the new directory: './configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/amit/fixedcoreutils'

Now run 'make' and 'make install' once again. Notice that trying
'fixedcoreutils/bin/ls -l' and comparing with 'ls -l' yields identical
results. Running 'coreutils/bin/ls -l' allows you to see the old, unfixed
version of ls.

Now, we check to make sure it works on a file that is at least a year old.
Run 'touch -t 201209141001 someoldfile' and compare the results of 
'fixedcoreutils/bin/ls -l' and 'ls -l'. They should both have the date
Sep. 14 2012.
