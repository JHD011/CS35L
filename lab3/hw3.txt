Q1. It appears that line was supposed to be part of a switch statement, but
    there is an unintentional underscore after the word case. In the diff, 
    you can see the line above it omits the underscore. Thus, the fix omits
    it because it was incorrect.

Q2. It looks like the original code would get the locale format, then loop
    through the first two characters which specify the language (e.g. EN) and
    use that language. It appears Brady's version no longer does this, so it
    could pose some problems in that it no longer changes language versions.

Q3. Trying to run the script on an empty file gives the following stack trace:

     Traceback (most recent call last):
       File "randline.py", line 70, in <module>
	 main()
       File "randline.py", line 64, in main
	 sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
       File "randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
	 return random.choice(self.lines)
       File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/random.py", line 274, in choice
	 return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if seq 
	 is empty
     IndexError: list index out of range
    
    You can see that the python interpreter throws an IndexError when trying to 
    access an index of an empty string.

Q4. Trying to run randline.py under python3 gives the following error:

     File "randline.py", line 65
     except IOError as (errno, strerror):
    
    The error happens because of changes in syntax between python 2.x and
    python 3 involving usage of tuples.
