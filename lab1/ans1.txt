Lab #1

1. 
man -k SOME_STRING
Found by searching through all the options in "man man", then looking up what
the "apropos" command does.

2. 
cp: /bin/cp /usr/share/man/man1p/cp.1p.gz /usr/share/man/man1/cp.1.gz
wc: /usr/bin/wc /usr/share/man/man1p/wc.1p.gz /usr/share/man/man1/wc.1.gz
Found using the "whereis" hint provided in lab.

3.
The three executables with single-name are [, w, and X
w shows who is logged in and what they are doing
X is a portable, network-transparent window system
[ evaluates a conditional expression

The three commands were found by executing "ls -d ?" in the /usr/bin directory.
Their descriptions were found in their man pages, except for the description of
[, which does not have a man page.

4.
/etc/alternatives/emacs
Found by going into the /usr/bin folder, then executing "ll | less" to search
the list of files in the current directory. Searching for "emacs" in less shows
that it is a soft link to /etc/alternatives/emacs

5.
g+s sets the group id (gid) bit in chmod symbolic mode
o-w makes a file non-writeable by others
Found by reading about symbolic mode in the chmod man pages

6. 
find DIRECTORY -mtime -21
Found by searching the find man pages for the word "time" until the
appropriate command was found

7.
find . -mtime -21
./Documents
./Documents/cs31
./Documents/cs31/project1

8.
There are 354 symbolic links in /usr/bin/
Found by using "whereis find" to find the location of find, then using
"find . -maxdepth 1 -type l | wc -l" to print out how many symbolic links
there are.

9.
The oldest file in /usr/lib is libgamin-1.so.0.1.10, from Mar. 3, 2010,
using ll -t
Found by searching the ls man pages for the word "time", and iterating
through the search results until a command was found that listed the
elements by age.

10.
When used without arguments, locale gets its data from the LC_*
environmental variables.
Found by reading the locale man pages.

11.
The emacs commands containing sort are:
Buffer-menu-sort
Buffer-menu-sort-by-column
ibuffer-invert-sorting
ibuffer-toggle-sorting-mode
rmail-sort-by-author
rmail-sort-by-correspondent
rmail-sort-by-date
rmail-sort-by-labels
rmail-sort-by-lines
rmail-sort-by-recipients
rmail-sort-by-subject
sort-columns
sort-fields
sort-lines
sort-numeric-fields
sort-pages
sort-paragraphs
sort-regexp-fields

Found by using C-h a to search commands,
as mentioned in the emacs tutorial.

12.
C-M-a moves to the beginning of a current or preceding defun
C-M-b moves backwards across one balanced expression
C-M-c exits from the innermost recursive buffer
C-M-d moves forward down one level of parentheses
C-M-e moves to the end of a current of following defun
C-M-f moves forward across one balanced expression
C-M-h marks the current or following defun

Found by using C-h b to search key bindings, then using C-s "C-M-a" to
find all the commands in order.

13.
C-g allows you to quit out of a running command (like a search), or to
quit out of a partially-typed command.

14.
Yank pastes the last text killed.
Found by using C-h b to find key bindings, and C-s "yank" to find the
definition of the command.

15. 
From visually comparing the dired command in emacs and the output of
ls -l, it appears the only difference is that emacs shows the ".." and
"." directories for the parent and current directories, while ls -l does not.
